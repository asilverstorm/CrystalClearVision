### About

This is a fork of the BetterDiscord Theme ClearVision that I have just customized to my liking. My customizations include removing the background images and making the window transparent, removing the ClearVision Branding, setting different UI colors, and overall readability improvements (specifically with dropdown menus).

ASSUME CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO ALL FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY BY ASILVERSTORM - THIS DISCLAIMER IS MADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APACHE LICENSE


## Installing

For BetterDiscord:
 [releases] Download from [HERE](https://github.com/asilverstorm/CrystalClearVision/tree/master/dist) and move the .theme.css and dependencies folder directly into BetterDiscord's themes folder @ `%appdata%\rbetterdiscord\themes`


### Dependencies

- [NodeJS/npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm)
- [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
- [PostCSS Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)
- [PostCSS CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-cli)

I just ran `npm install` and that seemed to work so imma not care about pnpm. Also I'm just straight up editing the already compiled files from the original src code so that folder is really just here to refer back to if needed.
